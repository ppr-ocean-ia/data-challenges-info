# About

This repository is intended to host the tools that will be used for the "High-resolution monitoring and forecasting of tropical
cyclones" data challenge. 


## Content

- **Summary.pdf** contains a brief description of the data challenge. 
      
- **Proposal.pdf** contains the initial data challenge proposal, which is likely to evolve as the data challenge develops and is therefore not the definitive description of its content.
