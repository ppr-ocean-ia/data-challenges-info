# About

This repository is intended to host the tools that will be used for the "Marine Biodiversity Prediction" data challenge. 


## Content

- **Summary.pdf** contains a brief description of the data challenge. 
      
- **Proposal1.pdf** and **Proposal2.pdf** contain the two initial data challenges proposals. The data challenge in its current form is a merger of these two proposals initially formulated by two different teams. Their content is likely to evolve as the data challenge develops and is therefore not a definitive description of the merged data challenge.
